Sunnshine Lane Community Centre- Website

This site was built with the intention of replicating and borrowing inspiration from existing community centres in Sydney.

I chose to make this site because I had previously worked at a Community Centre and was tasked to handle data entry and admin related tasks. I picked up their systems quickly, and was able to tweak and implement changes that saved time as well as improve the usability of the website. 

Communication with their web development provider was often difficult and expensive. The centre itself is a non-for profit, with no one in their team who was able to translate the emails going back and forth about adding new features, why something was not working the way it was intended to and lacking clear communication around deadlines and expectations. It was a driving force behind why I wanted to learn to do it for myself. It made me aware of how important understanding programming languages and web devolopment is. 

Planning:

For this project, I simply modelled the content, components and features from existing sites. The focus was to create a class booking system for the user and an admin dashboard that would create and edit classes.

Regrettably, I did not take to pen and paper as I have done in the past. Without this crucial filtering process I was not effectively tracking my progress during the build. In future I would pencil out a good chunk of time, even a day to brainstorm, assign priority and give deadlines for myself. Also, with the amount of research and resources I ended up using it I would have served me well to block out specific gathering of resources time, so I could refer to appropriate docs I had found ahead of time. It did get quite scramble-y in the last couple of days.

The Build: 

I used Firebase for the backend and React for the front end.

Overall:

I used bootstrap and react bootstap to save time on styling. Typically I love to spend time with CSS but I had to keep moving so bootsrap was essential to implement. I used CSS to make the logo. 

There are multiple forms and booking options throughout the site. These are the various stages of my builds. I have included them to visually represent a working feature. Some do not in fact work as intended. 

Notably, the edit class form was a real mission to do. It's not done. In fact I broke it during an internet outage and refactored my code desperatly trying to fix what may not have been broken. Was it working but the internet was down when I sent my post request? Should I have gone to bed and tackled it in the morning? In my heart, I know i should have pushed to git. So really the lesson here is, Git is good. 


Backend:

Honestly, the biggest take away from this project has been- KNOW YOUR DATA. 
I used Firebase realtime data base, and then I switched to Firestore. 
I was learning Firestore on the fly, refering to snippets of documantation as it applied to my needs. Again, it would be beneficial to at least have the overview of Firebase before I started building. I was limited by this gap in knowledge but by keeping my data flat and simple I was able to spend more time on the front end.

Frontend:

React was at times a pleasure and pain to work with. During this build my understanding of states and hooks were deepening. I may contradict myself here, but I was so focussed on building that I skimmed over some crucial learning moments. However, I now have an extensive: To Study List as a result.

Next Steps:

I want to consolidate the code I have written to be more efficent and readable. There is some hideous indentation. My apologies to those who dare venture to read the code as is. 

To fix my edit form!

There is a timetable feature that I want to be responsive. 

The admin dashboard is not infact exclusive to admin.

The class bookings need some serious TLC.

That is all for now.
